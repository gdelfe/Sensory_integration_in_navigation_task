## Stastical analysis and signal processing of neural data of a navigation task for non-human primates

This project is done within <a href="https://angelakilabnyu.org">Dora Angelaki</a>'s lab, NYU, Center for Neural Science.

In this project I analysize LFP and spike signals recorded from the monkey brain of 4 different animals performing a navigation task in a virtual environment. The animals must navigate the area throughout the use of a joypad till they reach a target location. The target location is shown to the animal on a screen for about 200 ms before the beginning of the trial and then the target disappears. The monkey must remember the location of the target to succeed in the navigation task. If the monkey reaches the target gets a reward (juice) otherwise no reward is given. 

There are 3 sensory perturbation that occur during the task:
1. Change in the density of the optic flow of the virtual area (a parameter which controls how well the virtual environment is visible to the monkey)
2. Perturbation of the trajectory of the monkey 
3. Perturbation of the acceleration of the joypad
